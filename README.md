# VULF100REPEAT


First of all, thanks to VULF for the great music.

There are parts of their music that I would like to replay 100 or even 200 times.

I am sure there are more than a few people who feel that way, so I took the plunge and shared it with you.



The videos can be made with 100% coding.

The program first goes to read the information in the jsoon file.
You can play around with the "d" value in the code.
The value of "dur" specifies the duration of the iteration, and "begin_sec" specifies the beginning of the iteration.


This is mainly achieved with moviepy.
If you have any questions, please feel free to ask.

I will update this page as needed.
